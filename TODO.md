# TODOs

 * Convert project to use setuptools or an equivalent.
 * Make a cleaner split between drivers, animations and triggering.
 * Clean up the variable names in the meteo script - this is much
   to hacky and partially written in German because by English weather
   lingo is not fluent enough.
